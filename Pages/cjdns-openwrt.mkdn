This is an [OpenWRT](openwrt.org/) feed for the [cjdns](https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns) project.  You can check dd-wrt's [Router Database](http://www.dd-wrt.com/site/support/router-database) or OpenWRT's [Table of Hardware](http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start) for compatibility.


##Building OpenWRT w. cjdns

###Dependencies
This is by no means a full list.

**Debian**

    apt-get install git subversion cmake build-essential libplib-dev

###Download latest OpenWRT source

    svn co svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/trunk/ openwrt
    cd openwrt
    cp ./feeds.conf.default ./feeds.conf
    echo 'src-git cjdns git://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns-openwrt.git' >> ./feeds.conf
    ./scripts/feeds update -a
    ./scripts/feeds install cjdns nacl
    make prereq

Install any packages **make prereq** says are missing.

###Configuring OpenWRT w. cjdns

Check OpenWRT's [Table of Hardware](http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start) to find your chipset/target system.
	
        make menuconfig

Select target system

        make defconfig
        make menuconfig

Network > Routing and Redirection > [*] cjdns
(Press space twice)

        make

The packages can be found in the ./bin directory under a directory named after your router's architecture such as **./bin/brcm47xx**.

###Build notes
* Threading compilation (eg: **make -j 4**) may speed up build on multicore processors, but you should try without threading if you experience issues.
* Try make V=s to diagnose if you experience issues.
* You can start fresh and remove anything compiled, as well as the configuration with **make distclean**.  You will have to install the feeds and re-configure again.
* Start off simple and don't install additional modules/options until you've familiarized yourself.
* Read OpenWRT's [Troubleshooting Guide](http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build#troubleshooting) and cjdns-openwrt [Issues](https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns-openwrt/issues) for more information.
* Binaries
	* `.bin` Should be used if your router does not currently have OpenWRT firmware installed
	* `.trx` Should be used to upgrade previously installed OpenWRT firmware

###Update/Rebuild
    rm ./dl/cjdns-*
    ./scripts/feeds update cjdns
    make


###WRT54G v5

Installing OpenWRT has the potential of bricking your router.  Installing OpenWRT w. cjdns is still premature and it is not a recommended/supported.  Please be aware of the potential damage that could be caused to your hardware if following these instructions.

####One-Time Preparation

Some routers require a custom bootloader which requires special preparation for a successful installation.  These steps should be a one-time-only requirement.

	sudo apt-get install atftp
	atftp --option "mode octet" --option "timeout  60" --verbose --trace -p -l OPENWRT-CJDNS-FIRMWARE-FILE.bin 192.168.1.1

* `.bin` Should be used if your router does not currently have OpenWRT firmware installed
* `.trx` Should be used to upgrade previously installed OpenWRT firmware
